<b>FdF</b>

This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).<br>
Your program has to represent the model in isometric projection.<br>
The coordinates of the landscape are stored in a .fdf file passed as a parameter to
your program.<br>
Each number represents a point in space:<br>
• The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.<br>
• The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.<br>
• The value corresponds to its altitude.<br>

Using MLX42.
